Hi there! your submission has been removed as your account does not meet our minimum posting requirements. We require that your account be a few days old and that you have been making positive comments on reddit before you can post, even if you believe your post follows the rules. **If you have negative comment karma you won't be able to post here until it is positive and you have a few comment karma points.** So making good comments for a few days before posting almost always works.

Merch posts go in the [merch thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/search?q=author%3AAnimeMod+title%3A%22Merch+Mondays%22&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=week) (all weekly threads are open throughout the week, just posted on specific days).

In an effort to keep our content focused, we don't allow memes. Try /r/animememes or /r/anime_irl

####Spoiler rules 

**We consider any and all media applicable to our spoiler rule, whether it is an anime, a book, a movie, whether it was released yesterday or 100 years ago**. And please don't make obnoxious hints such as ""Haha, don't get too attached to that character, what happened to him had me *dying* of laughter"".

We also don't use the `>!spoiler!<` code as it shows as plaintext on some apps. To learn how to use the ones on our subreddit, please read the subreddit guide mentioned before.

If you have any other questions don't hesitate to contact us or your fellow subreddit members in the [Casual Discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/anime/search?q=title%3A%22Casual+Discussion+Fridays%22+author%3AAnimeMod&restrict_sr=on&sort=new&t=week). We look forward to seeing you around!

&nbsp;

**If you plan on posting, we've prepared a quick rundown of our posting guidelines:**

 * Put your timezone or region somewhere in your post.
 * Do not put your gender identity in your post. More information and exclusions to this rule can be found in the full rules. 
 * Do not advertise servers, communities, channels, etc. *
 * Do not use r/GamerPals for dating. *

&nbsp;

\* Rules with an asterisk are zero-tolerance - failure to follow them may result in a ban at the moderator's discretion. 

&nbsp;

**If you are having trouble finding GamerPals, here are some tips from fellow GamerPals:**

* Including the games you play will help people get to know you. If you're playing on PC, you can link your steam profile to show others what games you play. Remember to set your steam profile to public, else this wont work!
* High effort and creative posts/replies typically get more attention than others. Original titles may attract more attention than others!
* Reposting after a few days can help expose your post to more potential GamerPals, but please don't spam!
* Spell-check your post/replies. Typos can sometimes prevent you from communicating properly. 

&nbsp;

Have fun, and good luck finding some GamerPals!

Hereâ€™s some information to get you started with reddit.  

### How it all works  

1. Users post to communities, also known as subreddits. 
2. Other users vote and comment on those posts. 
3. Based on those votes, the best posts rise to the top for all to enjoy.

Users who post or comment earn karma points when their content gets voted up, or upvoted. 

As youâ€™re participating, be aware that each subreddit has its own unique personality and rules, usually found in their sidebar.
